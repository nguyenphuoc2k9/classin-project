            <p>Coding is the process of creating instructions
            for computers to follow. Just like people use different
            languages such as English and Spanish, so do programs. Roblox uses the coding language Lua.
            In Roblox, lines of Lua code are held in scripts. These
            scripts give the game sets of instructions on how to give
            players health points, create a rain of fireballs, or anything else imaginable.</p>

            <p>Studio is the building tool of Roblox that helps you to
            create the places of your dreams. It provides our Developers
            with a more comprehensive and intricate set of tools, which
            allows for a greater sense of control and creative expression.
            Roblox Studio's features are accessible to a variety of skill levels
            ranging from a novice to an experienced programmer. Tools range from
            simple manipulation of objects or terrain, to entering complex scripts

            isolated environment before uploading them to the Roblox website.</p>
