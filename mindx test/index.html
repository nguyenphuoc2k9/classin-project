        <p>Studio is the building tool of Roblox that helps you to
        create the places of your dreams. It provides our Developers
        with a more comprehensive and intricate set of tools, which
        allows for a greater sense of control and creative expression.
        Roblox Studio's features are accessible to a variety of skill levels
        ranging from a novice to an experienced programmer. Tools range from
        simple manipulation of objects or terrain, to entering complex scripts
        and game functions. Studio also allows you to test your games in an 
        isolated environment before uploading them to the Roblox website.</p>

        <p>Coding is the process of creating instructions
            for computers to follow. Just like people use different
            languages such as English and Spanish, so do programs. Roblox uses the coding language Lua.
            In Roblox, lines of Lua code are held in scripts. These
            scripts give the game sets of instructions on how to give
            players health points, create a rain of fireballs, or anything else imaginable.</p>
